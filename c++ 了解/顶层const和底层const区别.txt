As weâ€™ve seen, a pointer is an object that can point to a different object. As a result,we can talk independently about whether a pointer is const and whether the objectsto which it can point are const. We use the term top-level const to indicate that thepointer itself is a const. When a pointer can point to a const object, we refer tothat const as a low-level const.
